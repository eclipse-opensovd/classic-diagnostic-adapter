= MDD Embedded Files API

== Motivation

When an additional private SOVD-Server is tasked with providing functionality that replaces classic offboard-tester functionality, utilizing the CDA, additional data from the single-ecu-job embedded in the original `pdx`-file can be required.

The odx-converter offers an option to include code-files from the pdx, as well as partial contents from those files. This API allows the retrieval of these files.
