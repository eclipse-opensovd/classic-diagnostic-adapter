= Single ECU Jobs

== Motivation

When a client wants to replace the classical single-ecu-jobs defined in the odx description, it could need the original input/output parameters from those jobs. This API provides access to the data for the single-ecu-jobs, which were present in the original odx at the time of conversion.

== Retrieving data

NOTE: The available data may depend on the currently detected variant, since the ecu jobs are defined for variants.

The following paths will be available within the `/components/+{ecuName}+` path:

|===
|Method|Path|Description

|GET
|/x-single-ecu-jobs
|Retrieves a list of single ecu job items

|GET
|/x-single-ecu-jobs/+{id}+
|Reads the data for an entry
|===

Read the
xref:{rootpath}/architecture/03_sovd-api/openapi/single-ecu-jobs.yaml[Single ECU Jobs OpenAPI specification]
for details.
