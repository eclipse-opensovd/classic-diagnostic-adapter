= Single ECU Jobs

== Motivation

When a client wants to replace the classical single-ecu-jobs from the odx description, it could need the original input/output parameters from those jobs. This API provides the data for the single-ecu-jobs, which were present in the original odx at the time of conversion.

== Retrieving data
