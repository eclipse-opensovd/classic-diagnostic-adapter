|Expected positive response (if required)
|7E00
|

|CP_TesterPresentExpNegResp
|Expected negative response (if required)
|7F3E
|A tester present error should be reported in the log, tester present sending should be continued

|CP_RepeatReqCountApp
|Repetition of last request in case of timeout, transmission or receive error
|2
|Only applies to application layer messages

|CP_RC21Handling
|Repetition mode in case of NRC 21
|Continue until RC21 timeout
a|
* 0 = Disabled
* 1 = Continue handling negative responses until CP_RC21CompletionTimeout
* 2 = Continue handling unlimited

|Time between a NRC 0x21 and the retransmission of the same request (in µS)
|200000
|

|CP_RC78Handling
|Repetition mode in case of NRC 78
|Continue until RC78 timeout
a|
* 0 = Disabled
* 1 = Continue handling negative responses until CP_RC78CompletionTimeout

|Timeout after sending a successful request, for the complete reception of the response message (in µS)
|1000000
|In case of a timeout CP_RepeatReqCountApp has to be used to retry until a final timeout is reported
