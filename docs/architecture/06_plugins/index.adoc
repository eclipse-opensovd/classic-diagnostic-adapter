== Overview

The plugin system in the Classic Diagnostic Adapter (CDA) provides extensibility for vendor-specific functionality that cannot be standardized across all implementations. Plugins enable customization of security mechanisms, authentication flows, and other domain-specific requirements while maintaining the core diagnostic functionality.

The plugin architecture is designed around trait-based interfaces that allow runtime polymorphism and flexible configuration. This approach ensures that the CDA can adapt to different deployment environments and vendor requirements without requiring modifications to the core codebase.

== Security Plugin Architecture

The security plugin system is the primary plugin implementation within the CDA, responsible for authentication, authorization, and access control for REST calls.

=== Core Traits

The security plugin system is built around several key traits that define the plugin interface:

==== SecurityPlugin
The main trait that combines authentication and authorization capabilities:

```rust
pub trait SecurityPlugin: Any + SecurityApi + AuthApi {
    fn as_auth_plugin(&self) -> &dyn AuthApi;
    fn as_security_plugin(&self) -> &dyn SecurityApi;
}
```

==== AuthApi
Provides access to user claims:

```rust
pub trait AuthApi: Send + Sync + 'static {
    fn claims(&self) -> Box<&dyn Claims>;
}
```

==== SecurityApi
Validates diagnostic service requests based on security policies:

```rust
pub trait SecurityApi: Send + Sync + 'static {
    fn validate_service(&self, service: &DiagnosticService) -> Result<(), DiagServiceError>;
}
```

==== SecurityPluginLoader
Combines initialization and authorization request handling capabilities:

```rust
pub trait SecurityPluginLoader:
    SecurityPluginInitializer + AuthorizationRequestHandler + Default + 'static
{
}
```

=== Plugin Lifecycle

The security plugin follows a specific lifecycle during request processing:

1. **Middleware Registration**: The security plugin middleware is registered during router setup
2. **Request Interception**: Each incoming request passes through the security middleware
3. **Plugin Initialization**: The plugin extracts authentication information from request headers and creates the plugin instance
4. **Request Processing**: The initialized plugin instance is made available to route handlers
5. **Service Validation**: Diagnostic services are validated against security policies before execution

== Future Extensions

The plugin architecture is designed to support additional plugin types:

=== Logging Plugins
- Custom log formatting and destinations
- Integration with external logging systems
- Performance metrics collection

=== Safety Plugins
- Functional safety compliance validation
- Diagnostic session safety checks
- Emergency shutdown procedures

=== Custom Endpoint Plugins
- Vendor-specific API extensions
- Additional data formats and protocols
- Integration with external systems
