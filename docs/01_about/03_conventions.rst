Sections
--------

Section headers (ref) are created by underlining (and optionally overlining) the section title with a punctuation character, at least as long as the text:

* ``#`` with overline, for components (e.g. classic diagnostic adapter, odx-converter)
* ``*`` with overline, for parts (about, requirements, architecture, design, implementation, tests)
* ``=`` for chapters within parts
* ``-`` for sections within chapters
* ``^`` for subsections
* ``"`` for subsubsections
* ``~`` for subsubsubsections
